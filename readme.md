# Bluesillybeard's submission for Acerola Game Jam 0

It's basically just bad fruit ninja

- Just like the original fruit ninja.
- I might make it more futuristic themed
- the game is separated into levels, and each level something happens to the player controls
    - mess with the cursor position (translate, scale, rotate)
    - input delay
